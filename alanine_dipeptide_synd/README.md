# WESTPA with SynD Propagator: Alanine Dipeptide Conformation Sampling

This example demonstrates running WESTPA using SynD for dynamics.

The generator is a 200 state discrete Markov model from Alanine Dipeptide MD simulations, and the progress coordinate is Phi/Psi angles.Original system is made with 50ps time lag of a 10 x 1 microsecond simulation.

`run.sh` should contain the bare minimum to run the system. `environment.yml` is there to speed up the process of building all the dependencies.
