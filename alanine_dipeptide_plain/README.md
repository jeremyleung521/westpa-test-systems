# WESTPA with Alanine Dipeptide in implicit solvent

This example demonstrates running WESTPA using alanine dipeptide in implicit solvent. The system is parameterized in ff14SB-onlysc in implicit solvent model igb=1. The lack of "80" in the name indicate that the gamma_ln collision frequency is set to 5 ps^{-1} used when water molecules are explicitly modeled.

The WE Tau chosen is 100ps. The starting structure is a conformation found in C7eq well of the Phi/Psi Ramachandran plot.
